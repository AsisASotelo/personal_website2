        comment: "Welcome to my website. I enjoy simple design aesthetics so I did my best to keep it as simple as possible. This website is relatively new but it is as good a starting point as any. My goal is to continue updating it and adding sections as I meander through life. As for me, I love eating and making food. I like to listen to hip hop and R&B. I play music whenever I am not working or working on this site. Growing up in Southern Californa I am a lover of the outdoors, coffee, and a sunny day. As for my background, I graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara (Go Gauchos), with a degree in Physics. I love science, and it has introduced me to the power of computation and data analysis. This is where I spend most of my efforts nowadays.  This page acts as a journal of sorts which stores pertinent information in my life. Throughout this website you can find links to projects, a blog (which still needs to be created), and hopefully more. You may contact me if you have any questions, feedback, or just to say hello !",
